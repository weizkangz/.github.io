We Iz Kangz Websike project

---------------------------------------------

June 20, 2017: 

This is the beginning of the OPENSOURCE website project for We Iz Kangz.
I want the site to be responsive and interactive. I noticed some restrictions
In the descriptions from github. We will cross that bridge when we get to it.

We Iz Kangz is about the END of racism and brings DISRUPTIVE history to the front.

The OLD We Iz Kangz website is here: https://www.WeIzKangz,com
